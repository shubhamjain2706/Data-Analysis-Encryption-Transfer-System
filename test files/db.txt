The title of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is so detailed that you almost don’t need an official synopsis of any kind. From that collection of words, you can easily extrapolate the following: the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel will fight each other, but it will ultimately lead to them teaming up and forming the Justice League. Anyway, the actual, official synopsis for Zack Snyder’s superhero throwdown has arrived and it confirms everything you expect it to confirm.

Like so many big revelations surrounding big movies like this, the official synopsis didn’t arrive in direct connection with the film, but through the impending Licensing Expo in Las Vegas. It’s the year 2015, where we get our spoilers from LEGO sets and plot synopses from “the meeting place for the global licensing industry, whether you are looking to spot trends, build strategic partnerships or secure promotional tie-ins.” Anyway, here is the quick rundown of the film’s plot:

Fearing the actions of a god-like super hero left unchecked, Gotham City’s own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs.  And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it’s ever known before.

As we’ve long suspected thanks to the initial teaser and basic common sense, Ben Affleck’s Batman will start a brawl with Henry Cavill’s Superman because he’s concerned about what an all-powerful alien being can do to the human race. To be fair, we don’t blame Batman for wanting to take action – we saw what happened to Metropolis after the battle with Zod. If we had a billionaire’s budget and nerves of steel, we’d take action, too.

More importantly, the synopsis also reveals what we have also long suspected: there will be an external threat that will, presumably, force the heroes to team up and seek the aid of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman. Which brings us to the potential spoilers that have been floating around for the past few months...
